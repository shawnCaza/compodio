Scott\'s guest is Janet Patterson, a Thunder Bay woman who has been working for over 30 years to improve the lives of her fellow injured workers. She is a board member of the Injured Workers\' Support Group and the President of the Ontario Workers\' Network. The program ends with a look at the history of the workers\' compensation system in Ontario. The first law in the country related to workers compensation was passed in 1886.\n\nIt left the process in the courts, but it did not allow workers to sue for damages. As time passed, juries began to hold employers responsible for accidents and the labor movement began to organize around the issue. The groundwork was laid to reform the system in 1914. The reforms were based on a report by Chief Justice Sir William Meredith who found that workers had been cheated by the current system and that workers were better off without it.',NULL,NULL),

Plus, you\'ve got to be very good at encouraging people to do better. This means that you have a very specific plan for how to do this. Basically, he writes down what he thinks are the good things in the speech and then uses that as a guide to make sure that the speech is as good as it can possibly be. He also has a little chart he uses to record how he thinks the speech was overall. He has a big chart on the left side that lists all of his notes, and he uses this to judge how well the speech did. He then uses the chart to say two things: 1) they did a good job and 2) they can keep doing the same thing.\n\nSo that\'s it. Wow, this is a really awesome plan.

So REITs just enable a kind of class of people to get into the game.

First, the Canadian government has announced that the Indian government has murdered a Canadian citizen, a Sikh man named Hardeep Nijar. This news has caused tensions with India, who has issued an international travel advisory for anyone from the Indian state visiting Canada. This has also brought up the frosty relationship between the two countries at the G20. The program also discusses the upcoming military cooperation summit being held in India. It is not clear if this summit will have any negative effects on Canada, but it will certainly have a chilling effect on other countries. The Canadian government is not in any hurry to cancel the summit. It has, however, shut down the business of the country\'s embassy in India after the failed trade talks with India. If this is the case, it is highly unusual, and it is a blow to the Canadian political system.

He also says that when you create a trusting relationship with a client, you can never really get rid of them.\n\nHe adds that there\'s an \"overlay between domestic violence and human trafficking\" , which is why it takes multiple attempts to get a victim back. The detective says that government agencies are starting to look into this issue, and they\'ve gotten a lot of grants and funding for it.\n\nHe says that\'s why some of the statistics are getting better. He\'s also happy that there are more people who are trying to help victims, since it\'ll make it easier for them to get help. He suggests that if you see something that looks like a domestic situation, then you can call Crime Stoppers. You can just say that it looks like someone is fighting or kicking or scratching. If the girl doesn1t want to get into the car, then that is a human trafficking situation. If you see someone who isn1t fighting or scratching, that is probably a domestic or human trafficking case.',NULL,NULL),

St. Denise is an advocate of caring leadership, the style that he promotes through his experience as a manager and an IT consulting executive. His journey was marked by resilience, adaptability, and agility. He embraced a sabbatical and now focuses on fostering caring leadership in the people of his sensory cultures.\n\nStephen asks if this is a utopian vision, or can you really achieve this human centric, hiring, and nurturing culture? Well, yes, of course, but it is definitely achievable. The pandemic kind of showed that there is a softer side to leaders when it comes to compassion, caring and understanding. But it may now be gone, but that may not be going away. It is a lot of work, but St.Denise believes that it is possible.',NULL,NULL),

The bank forms are complicated, confusing, and even illegal. The most common form is called the \"Model Assignment of Lease-Consent Agreement for Manufactured Homes\" or \"1097.\n\n\" It\'s confusing because it adds too many terms onto the landlord and it puts the bank in a sub-licence with the land owner. Landlord\'s are getting frustrated with the confusing, confusing form and they\'re not signing it. Fort Folly has set up a fund to buy land and donate it to conservation. And an artist named Borsh is back in town for the show. He has a new sculpture that he\'s been working on for 23 years. 23 years ago, he sold his sculpture to a buyer for $430 and he sold it to a customer for $430.

She began experiencing strange symptoms, including seeing things and hearing voices. She was hospitalized in July of 2009, and the doctors thought she had a mood disorder.

We also learn that the city of Winnipeg is in the process of launching a drug impaired driving campaign. The campaign will target drivers under the effects of cannabis, edibles, and other drugs. The risks of driving under the influence, according to the police, are related to delayed onset of the drug. Unlike smoked or ingested drugs, edibles can last several hours. The delay leads to over-consumption and an \"overwhelming level of impairment\". The police also have new equipment to test drivers for drugs, including field sobriety tests. Last year, the police arrested 243 drivers, 148 drivers tested positive for drugs and 36 people were arrested for possession of drugs.',NULL,NULL),
