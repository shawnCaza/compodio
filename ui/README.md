This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation
1. In a terminal, navigate to the ui folder of the project `cd ui`
2. Install next.js and it's dependencies: `npm install`
3. In /UI rename `.env.local_default` file to `.env.local`

The values in `.env.local_default` by default point to the remote development server. 

- If you are running the a local server with the php api from the [data folder](data/README.md), you will need to change the values in `.env.local` to point to your local server.
